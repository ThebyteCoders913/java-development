# Java Development by Ayush 🚀

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository documents my progress from the **very basics** to advanced topics, as I work toward becoming a job-ready Java developer. I started late, but I'm learning with full focus and consistency 💯.

## 🧱 Foundations Covered

Before diving into arrays and OOPs, I built a strong foundation in:

- 🧮 Variables and Data Types
- 🔁 Loops (for, while, do-while)
- 🔀 Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
- 📥 Input/Output in Java
- 🧩 Functions and Methods (return types, parameters, calling)
- 🧹 Basic Debugging and Code Cleanup
  

These basics helped me understand how logic flows and how to dry-run code effectively.

## 📚 Topics Covered
-  🧱 Foundation Level - Variables and Data Types , Loops (for, while, do-while),Conditional Statements (if-else, switch),Input/Output in Java, Functions and Methods (return types, parameters, calling)
- 🔢 Arrays
- 🔲 Matrix Operations
- 🧠 Core java ConceptsObject-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- 🛠️ Mini Projects

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

As a late starter in Java, I'm documenting everything I learn—from basics to advanced—with dry runs, diagrams, and beginner-friendly explanations. This helps me and others who are learning from scratch.

## 📌 Goals

- Build strong Java fundamentals
- Create visual explanations for tough topics
- Share my journey publicly to inspire others
